### Running Unit test with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) On an Angular 4 project

The project aims to set up a project which will contain various different angular libs and run test of the codes that uses those libraries using Jest. The reason for setting up this project is Jest is very new testing framework and I am not sure how will it behave with different frameworks and libraries.

Currently working with the libraries listed below:

 * [Material](https://github.com/angular/material2)
 * [Angular CDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cdk)
 * [NGX Quill](https://github.com/surmon-china/ngx-quill-editor/) - with a issue but has a fix. Waiting for a response to created [issue#30](https://github.com/surmon-china/ngx-quill-editor/issues/30)

The project is based on [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io) and More library updates will be added gradually.
